Program test.c demonstrates that two different character devices can not be opend at the same time.
It creates two different character devices and try to open them one after another. 
Return values of the function open() checked using assert so it can be seen that:
-- When first is opened, the second can not be opened  - open returns -1.
-- It is possible to open the second device only when the first devise already closed.
